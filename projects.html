                <p>This website allows the user to store their favourite things from each category in the 
                    form of sticky-note-like posts, as well as keep a journal. PHP and MySQL are used to 
                    store and recall the posts. It is styled using a combination of pure CSS and 
                    Materialize. From this project, I increased my confidence with PHP and learned to 
                    balance Materialize with my own CSS to create my particular design. It was a project I 
                    had planned and designed all aspects of before begining construction, so I learned to 
                    organise the build into components that could be completed in each session.<br><br>

                <p>A live website, used by a private science tutor to promote his business. Styled mostly 
                    with Materialize; supplemented with pure CSS. The process of developing this website 
                    gave me experience of working to a client's specification, being sure to include all 
                    required aspects and delivering a finshed product that satisfied his vision. The 
                    project also introduced me to Materialize and the basics of JQuery. I not only learned 
                    to use the features of the framework but to customise it to my specific design needs.

                <p>This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display current weather data, as well as date and time information, in a location entered by the user. From this project, I learned how to interact with an API and process JSON data, as well as developing my knowledge of JavaScript and CSS. I particulary benefited from manipulating date and time data to change the design theme of the application with the time of day.</p>

                <p>The first website I created. I used it to test out my HTML and CSS skills, before 
                    developing an interest in PHP and MySQL. Through this project, I learned to set up and 
                    interact with databases. This was used to develop the user accounts and commenting 
                    systems. The project also began training my eye for web design and developing 
                    consistant layouts.<br><br>
